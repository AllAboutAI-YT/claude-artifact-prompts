# Data Visualization Prompts

1. **Initial Request:**
    ```
    I have uploaded data of the number of Software Engineering Jobs in the US since May 2020. I need different visual creative graphs/interactive illustrations to show the trends from this data. Can you create a React component using the standard library to create this for my presentation?
    ```

2. **Follow-up Requests:**
    ```
    Great. Add another section of the component with your thoughts around the reasons for these trends.
    ```

    ```
    Good job, now let's add some more visual style, like dark mode and more interesting graphics.
    ```

    ```
    (Add screenshot) Good start. The dark mode is not perfect yet (see image), fix the dark mode text visibility issues.
    ```

    ```
    Perfect, the only thing left is to make the text on the graph's x and y axis white in dark mode.
    ```

# Viral Physics Content Prompts

1. **Initial Request:**
    ```
    (Add image) Hello! I have uploaded an image of a ball simulation I want to create in a React Component. The canvas should be in a 9:16 format, and the ball should bounce back and forth when it hits the wall of the circle. Create the React component, please.
    ```

2. **Follow-up Requests:**
    ```
    Great job! Now add gravity so the ball acts like a marble bouncing in a glass circle, and add a raining matrix background around the circle filling the 9:16 canvas.
    ```

    ```
    Great! The only issue now is that the ball stops bouncing. This can't happen. Fix this for our random ball bouncer project.
    ```

    ```
    Make the ball bounce more randomly, acting like an unstable marble in a glass circle, and increase the speed by 200%.
    ```

    ```
    Great job! Add code to play the sound (bb.mp3) each time the ball bounces off the circle wall, please.
    ```

    ```
    Great, now add bb2.mp3, bb3.mp3, and bb4.mp4. The four sounds will play at random when the ball hits the wall.
    ```

# Add Component to My Website

1. **Initial Request:**
    ```
    (Upload all website files) I have uploaded all the files for my React/JS website. I want to add a component to my website called "matrix-game" in the menu. This React/JS component should be a simple game, stream the text:
    Wake up, Neo...
    The Matrix has you...
    Follow the white rabbit.

    Knock, knock, Neo.

    Then the user must pick a red (red.png) or a blue pill (blue.png). Based on the pill the user clicks, print the text:
    "You take the red pill... you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."
    "You take the blue pill... the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe."
    Also, play vo_1.mp3 if the red pill was picked, and vo_2.mp3 if the blue pill was picked.
    ```

2. **Follow-up Requests:**
    ```
    Write the full new updated `Website.js` code, please (don't skip any lines of code).
    ```

    ```
    Great, we need to add some more to `MatrixGame.js`: The red pill should be a sprite (redpill.png) and the blue pill a sprite (bluepill.png). When the user clicks one of the pills, create a red or blue particle explosion that covers the full website screen.
    ```

    ```
    Perfect! Play background sound (music.mp3) in `MatrixGame.js`, add a hardcoded volume setting, please.
    ```
